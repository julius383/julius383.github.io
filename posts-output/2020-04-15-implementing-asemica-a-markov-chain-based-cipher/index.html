    <p>What exactly is a cipher? To put it simply it is an algorithm for
performing encryption and decryption. Encryption being the process a piece
of information (known as plaintext) is transformed into an alternate
form (known as ciphertext) in such a way that knowing only the content
of the ciphertext can not lead to knowing the content of the plaintext.
Decryption is going the other way from ciphertext to plaintext.
Both encryption and decryption rely on a key that drives the operation
of the cipher. When the key changes ideally the same piece of plaintext
should produce a different piece of ciphertext but the result of applying
the right key to the right ciphertext should always lead to the same
plaintext. A key then is the one piece of information (other than the
plaintext obviously) that must remain secret. There are a lot of finer
points but that is the gist of it.</p><p>One other thing necessary to know before going into the discussion of
the Asemica cipher is what a Markov chain is. The precise definition
can be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">WikiPedia</a>. For our purposes all you need to know is
that it is a model where the probability of one event occurring depends
only on the value (state) of the preceding event. That still sounds a bit
cryptic but it'll become clearer later on.</p><h2 id="how-asemica-operates">How Asemica Operates</h2><p>Before we begin I'd like to state that the algorithm was formulated by
a person called <a href="https://danne.stayskal.com/">Danne Stayskal</a> and the original implementation (in
Perl) is available in their <a href="https://github.com/linenoise/asemica">GitHub</a> profile. I cannot recall how I
found it initially but it was only until recently that I decided to try
and figure out how it works by re-implementing it in a language I am more
familiar with.</p><p>The reason I waited until recently to start my re-implementation effort
was because of needing to learn a bit of Perl to use for scripting on
Linux. Perl is a bit famous (infamous?) for being hard to read but after
only going through a few chapters of <a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781491954324">Learning Perl</a> and a healthy
amount of comments in the original source for Asemica, I was able to
understand how it works enough to write my own version.</p><p>Asemica relies on a regular document of text as a key. In order to
understand how it works it is necessary to understand how a document is
used as a key. The first step of the Asemica algorithm is turning the
document key into a table of unique words present in the document. For
any given word we keep track of all the words that appear directly after
it anywhere in the text and how many times they do. For ease of reference
the sequence of words-that-follow will be called <em>doors</em> and <em>exits</em> when
the sequence includes the occurrences.</p><p>After this mapping of words and their associated information - which we'll
refer to as the <em>transition table</em> - is created, those words with 15 or
more different words following it are considered <em>meaningful</em> as they are
able to represent a half a byte of information. All others are considered
meaningless. This table is used to carry out both encryption and
decryption.</p><h3 id="encryption">Encryption</h3><p>During encryption the plaintext is converted into a sequence of bytes
which are further converted into binary strings then grouped into half-byte
numbers (nibbles)<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. Then beginning a randomly chosen word from those
present in the document key which we will refer to as a <em>token</em> the
following series of steps is repeated until the nibble sequence is empty:</p><ul><li>The current <em>token</em> is appended to the ciphertext result string.</li><li>If the token is <em>meaningful</em> then a single value is popped from the
sequence of half-byte numbers and its integer value used to index
the list of <em>doors</em>.
This word becomes the next <em>token</em>.</li><li>If the <em>token</em> is not <em>meaningful</em> we randomly pick one of the <em>doors</em>
and use that as the <em>token</em> in the next iteration.</li></ul><p>As we can see moving from one <em>token</em> to the next is wholly dependent on
the value of the previous <em>token</em> which is exactly the type of relationship
that a Markov chain describes. The probability of moving to a state in
<em>doors</em> is $1/n$ where $n$ is the length of the <em>doors</em> sequence and
that of moving to a state not in <em>doors</em> is $0$.</p><h3 id="decryption">Decryption</h3><p>During decryption, the ciphertext is first split into a list of words.
The <em>words</em> list is iterated over until the second last element and
the following steps are carried out:</p><ul><li>Check if the current word is <em>meaningful</em> skipping it otherwise since
it could not have been used to encode a nibble.</li><li>Try and find the next word's index within the current word's
<em>doors</em>.</li><li>This index is converted into a binary string and appended to the
plaintext result string.</li></ul><p>At the end of the loop the plaintext string is just a long binary string
and not the intended message. To convert back into whatever was encrypted
the binary string is divided into groups of 8 (binary) characters.
These characters represent a single byte and are converted back
into the ASCII value they represent. The resulting string is the
original message.</p><h2 id="concrete-implementation">Concrete Implementation</h2><p>To implement Asemica I chose the <a href="http://factorcode.org">Factor</a> programming language which is
described on the homepage as:</p><blockquote><p>a concatenative, stack-based programming language with high-level
features including dynamic types, extensible syntax, macros, and
garbage collection.</p></blockquote><p>Apart from the features listed above one more that I think is useful is
the <a href="https://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-listener.html">listener</a> - basically an enhanced REPL - which is helpful for
interactive development.</p><h3 id="representing-a-transition">Representing A Transition</h3><p>The first detail to work out is how to represent the information present
in each entry of the transition table. For this we'll use a <a href="https://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-tuple-examples.html">Tuple</a>
which is similar to data classes in other languages. The syntax is
pretty straightforward<sup id="fnref-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>:</p><pre><code class="language-factor">TUPLE: transition
{ token      string }  ! raw string as it  appeared
{ seen       integer } ! how many times token has been seen
{ door       vector }  ! words after this one in document key
{ doors      integer } ! length of door vector
{ exits      assoc }   ! words after plus occurrence count
meaningful             ! true or false depending if doors &gt; 15 ;
</code></pre><p>The following is a <code>transition</code> value for one word. The key file used
was Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka downloaded from
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> as a text file:</p><pre><code class="language-json">{
    "token": "eBook",
    "seen": 12,
    "door": [
        "of",
        "is",
        "or",
        "Details",
        "First",
        "METAMORPHOSIS",
        "complying",
        "for"
    ],
    "doors": 8,
    "exits": [
        [ "of", 2 ],
        [ "is", 2 ],
        [ "or", 2 ],
        [ "Details", 1 ],
        [ "First", 1 ],
        [ "METAMORPHOSIS", 2 ],
        [ "complying", 1 ],
        [ "for", 1 ]
    ],
    "meaningful": false
}
</code></pre><h3 id="generating-the-transition-table">Generating the Transition Table</h3><p>The next step is actually building the <em>transition table</em>. To do this as
we saw earlier requires iterating through all the words in the document
key and checking which word follows each and updating the relevant
<code>transition</code> tuple. Rather than using an indexed loop on a single stream
of tokens I instead opted to use the <code>2each</code> combinator<sup id="fnref-3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> which requires
two sequences and a quotation on the stack. It is roughly equivalent to
the following Python snippet:</p><pre><code class="language-python">def two_each(seq1, seq2, f):
  for a, b in zip(seq1, seq2):
    f(a, b)

# example usage
two_each(range(5), range(1, 5), print)

# example output
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
</code></pre><p>We can already guess how to pair up each word with the one that follows
it and run a function on it<sup id="fnref-4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>.</p><pre><code class="language-factor">: 2tokens ( str -- a b )
    clean-string " " split dup rest ;

:: generate-transitions ( a b -- table )
    { } &gt;alist :&gt; ttable! ! create empty transition table
    a b ! tokens
    [
        :&gt; value
        :&gt; key
        ! get transition tuple if it exists or make new one
        key &gt;lower ttable new-or-existing
        key &gt;&gt;token
        ! update with information
        value swap update-transition-info
        ! modify the transition table
        key &gt;lower ttable assoc-add ttable!
    ] 2each ttable set-meaningful ; 
</code></pre><p>The <code>2tokens</code> word produces the two sequences we need from a string after
first cleaning the string (this is just removing extra spaces and
newlines among other things). These two sequences are used as input to the
<code>generate-transitions</code> word. Unlike most other stack-based programming languages, Factor allows using <a href="https://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-locals-examples.html">lexical variables</a> ( <code>::</code>, <code>:&gt;</code> ) which can be a lot more convenient than manipulating multiple different stack values.</p><h3 id="encryption-and-decryption">Encryption and Decryption</h3><p>The code responsible for encryption is not very complicated if you keep
a few of these Factor specific things in mind:</p><ul><li>How lexical variables (including mutable ones) <a href="https://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-locals-examples.html">work</a> .</li><li>Arguments to words are taken from the stack.</li><li><code>length</code> does what you expect and <code>index array nth</code> is <code>array[index]</code>
in Python.</li><li><code>key assoc at</code> is the same as <code>assoc[key]</code> where <code>assoc</code> would be
a dictionary in Python.</li><li><code>seq unclip</code> puts the first element and the rest of the sequence on
the stack in reverse order.</li><li><code>meaningful&gt;&gt;</code> is just how you access the slot named <code>meaningful</code> in
a tuple<sup id="fnref-5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>.</li></ul><p>The code for encryption is:</p><pre><code class="language-factor">
:: encode ( message transitions tokens -- encmessage )
    ! start with a random token
    tokens length safe-random tokens nth :&gt; token! 
    "" :&gt; encmessage!
    ! transform input into sequence of nibbles
    message unpack nibbles :&gt; nbs!
    [ nbs empty? ] [ 
        { encmessage token " " } concat encmessage!
        token &gt;lower transitions at meaningful&gt;&gt;
        [
            ! encrypt a nibble into a word
            nbs unclip
            token &gt;lower transitions at door&gt;&gt;
            nth token!
            nbs!
        ]
        [
         ! add random word to output without encrypting nibble
         token &gt;lower transitions at doors&gt;&gt; safe-random
         token &gt;lower transitions at door&gt;&gt; nth token!
        ] if
    ] until { encmessage token " " } concat ;
</code></pre><p>For the decryption word other than what we have already mentioned keep in
mind:</p><ul><li>Although iteration over structures is preferred over indexed iteration
the latter is still possible by using <code>&lt;iota&gt;</code> (similar to <code>range</code> in
Python) with the <code>each</code> combinator.</li><li><code>find</code> tries to find a value in a sequence that satisfies a quotation
and puts the index and the value on the stack or false for both.</li><li><code>when</code> is like an if statement without an else section.</li></ul><p>The decryption code is:</p><pre><code class="language-factor">:: decode ( input transitions tokens -- decmessage )
    "" :&gt; decoded!
    input clean-string " " split :&gt; words
    words length 1 - &lt;iota&gt; [
        :&gt; i
        i words transitions at-nth meaningful&gt;&gt;
        [  
            ! word encodes a nibble so try and find its value
            i words transitions at-nth door&gt;&gt; [ 
                &gt;lower i 1 + words nth &gt;lower =
            ] find 
            :&gt; elt
            :&gt; idx
            elt [ idx make-nibble decoded swap append decoded! ] when
        ] when
    ] each decoded pack ;
</code></pre><p>One final detail necessary for understanding how encryption and
decryption is done is the implementation of <code>pack</code> and <code>unpack</code>. They are
written to mimic the behaviour of <code>pack</code> and <code>unpack</code> in Perl with <code>b*</code>
as the template string. Here's <code>unpack</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-factor">: unpack ( str -- newstr )
    [ &gt;bin 8 zero-pad reverse ] { } map-as "" join ;
</code></pre><p>It converts a string such as "hello" into a binary string such as
"0001011010100110001101100011011011110110". It does this by converting
each character into a binary string (<code>&gt;bin</code>) then padding the string with
zeros until it is at least length 8 (<code>8 zero-pad</code>). It then reverses the
string to turn it into little endian form (least significant bit first).
The result for each character is concatenated together into a single
string.</p><p><code>pack</code> is slightly longer:</p><pre><code class="language-factor">:: pack ( str -- seq )
   0 str length 8 &lt;range&gt; [
        :&gt; start
        start 8 + :&gt; end 
        end str length &gt;
        [ str length ] [ end ] if
        start swap str subseq reverse bin&gt;
   ] { } map-as but-last &gt;string ;
</code></pre><p>It converts a string such as "0001011010100110001101100011011011110110"
back into "hello". It does this by iterating through the string in groups
of 8 characters (representing 1 byte / a single ASCII value). The 8
characters form a string which is reversed (to turn it back into
big endian form) before converting it back into an integer (<code>bin&gt;</code>). The
result is a sequence of numbers which can then be converted into an ASCII
string (<code>&gt;string</code>).</p><p>After adding a few other bits and pieces like argument parsing typical
usage of the program is shown below:</p><pre><code class="language-shell">$ echo "Pwagu hupata pwaguzi" | factor-vm -i=cust.img asemica.factor \
  -m enc -c metamorphosis.txt -o enc.txt
$ cat enc.txt
