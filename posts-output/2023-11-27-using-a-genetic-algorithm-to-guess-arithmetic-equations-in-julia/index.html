    <p>Genetic algorithms try to replicate the mechanisms of biological
evolution to solve problems. In this article we'll use a somewhat useless
example problem to demonstrate how to design and implement a genetic algorithm
in <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> which I have been trying to learn recently.</p><p>Taking the example of the expression <code>4 * 9 / 2 + 5 - 3</code>, we would normally
want to get the result of evaluating this expression. However, for our purposes
it is much more interesting to start off with a result and try and find an
expression that returns that result when evaluated. So for our example
we'd start with 20 then try and find an expression such as <code>4 * 5</code>.</p><h2 id="evolution-whats-that">Evolution, what's that?</h2><p>Before we can jump into writing code, it may be useful to understand at least
<em>some</em> of the underlying ideas behind the functioning of genetic algorithms key
of which is evolution. It is described on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution">WikiPedia</a> as:</p><blockquote><p>the change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over
successive generations. Evolution occurs when evolutionary processes such as
natural selection and genetic drift act on genetic variation, resulting in
certain characteristics becoming more or less common within a population over
successive generations.</p></blockquote><p>In general the more beneficial a certain trait is for survival, the more
likely it is to for organisms carrying it to survive long enough to pass on
their genes. This leads to the trait becoming more common in a population
during successive generations. This process is natural selection which was the
primary inspiration for genetic algorithms.</p><h2 id="genetic-algorithms">Genetic Algorithms</h2><p>Genetic algorithms are commonly used on problems where finding solutions
through more direct means is too resource intensive to be feasible. They
typically have a few key steps:</p><ol><li>Generating a random start population.</li><li>Selecting candidates for producing the next generation.</li><li>Using crossovers and mutations to create a new generation from the selected parents.</li><li>Checking if a solution has been found and terminating or going back to step 2.</li></ol><p>Each of the first 3 steps can vary in many different ways and how exactly you
do each could influence the performance of the final algorithm as a whole. I'll
try and keep things simple but I'll try to point out places where you could
change things up for anyone interested in exploring alternate approaches.</p><h2 id="translating-the-problem-into-code">Translating the Problem into code</h2><p>There's a lot more involved in genetic algorithms than just 4 steps. The first
thing we have to do is phrase our problem adequately. We need to figure
out what constitutes a population and how are traits in each member
represented so they can be "passed on". Keep in mind what we're trying to do
with the genetic algorithm is evolve the population until one of the members
fit the solution we are trying to find.</p><p>In this case a population would be a bunch of arithmetic expressions so it would
have members like <code>3 + 7 * 4</code>, <code>9 / 1 - 4</code>, <code>8</code> etc. More concretely an
expression would contain any number from 0 to 9 and the operators <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>,
<code>+</code> and <code>-</code>. There's the additional constraint that an expression can only be 9
terms long which is enough for each of the 4 operators to be used once. This
constraint is mostly just for simplicity's sake so there's no reason you couldn't
allow for longer expressions. Expressions are in the form of a single number
optionally followed by groups of operand and operator i.e
<code>[0-9]([+-*/][0-9])*</code>.</p><p>We'll take the entire expression as a chromosome and split each term into
individual genes. With a total of 14 possible options for each gene we need
at least 4 bits (<code>ceil(log2(14)) = 4</code>) to uniquely represent each gene.
With 9 genes per expression that works out to 36 bits total.</p><p>In our implementation we'll use a 64bit unsigned integer which can hold a
chromosome with room to spare. It is less likely that real world problems
would require so few bits so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array">bit arrays</a> are commonly used instead of
integers since they also support the bitwise operators necessary for crossover
and mutation operations but can be larger.</p><p>To make our lives easier and also because Julia has great support for working
in arrays, we'll have two alternate representations for expressions:</p><ul><li>An array of unsigned integers with each element corresponding to a gene.</li><li>A single 64bit unsigned integer with every 4 bits being a gene.</li></ul><p>Let's define these two representations along with methods to convert between
them.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">const GENE_SIZE = 4
const EXPRESSION_LENGTH = 9
const CHROMOSOME_SIZE = GENE_SIZE * EXPRESSION_LENGTH

Expression = Vector{UInt64} # unsigned integer technically only needs to be 4 bits
EncodedExpression = UInt64


expression_chars =
    ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '+', '-', '*', '/']

function encode(expression::Expression)::EncodedExpression
    res = EncodedExpression(0)
    for i in expression
        res &lt;&lt;= GENE_SIZE
        res |= i
    end
    return res
end

function decode(expression::EncodedExpression)::Expression
    expr = []
    expr_mask = (1 &lt;&lt; GENE_SIZE) - 1
    for _ in (1:EXPRESSION_LENGTH)
        v = expression &amp; expr_mask
        pushfirst!(expr, v)
        expression &gt;&gt;= GENE_SIZE
    end
    return expr
end

Base.convert(::Type{EncodedExpression}, x::Expression) =
    encode(x)
Base.convert(::Type{Expression}, x::EncodedExpression) =
    decode(x)
</code></pre><p>The <code>encode</code> functions takes a vector of genes (<code>Expression</code>) and crams
them all into a single unsigned 64bit integer (<code>EncodedExpression</code>).
<code>decode</code> does the reverse and extracts every 4 bits from said integer back
into a vector. A Vector in Julia is a one-dimensional array.</p><p>We define also add methods to <code>Base.convert</code> to make translating between the
two representations easier. Instead of needing to keep track of whether to
call <code>encode</code> or <code>decode</code>, we can just call <code>convert</code> with the type we want
and the value we want to convert.</p><p>Now that we have a data representation for expressions, it would be nice to
have a nice way to create expressions.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function make(str::String)::Expression
    e = []
    # remove '=' and anything that follows
    str = first(split(str, "="))
    for i in str
        if !(i in expression_chars)
            continue
        else
            push!(e, findfirst(isequal(i), expression_chars) - 1)
        end
    end
    return e
end

make("1 + 2")
</code></pre><pre><code>3-element Vector{UInt64}:
 0x0000000000000001
 0x000000000000000a
 0x0000000000000002
</code></pre><p>From the above code we can see that the value of each character in the
expression is equal to one less than it's index in the <code>expression_chars</code>
vector. This makes it easy to map between the programmatic and mathematical
representation of numbers. Based on this mapping we can check that numbers are
valid if they are between 0 and 9. Similarly operators are valid when they are
between 10 and 13. Let's write a function to check that an expression datatype
is correct.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">isnumber(x) = x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt;= 9
isoperator(x) = x &gt;= 10 &amp;&amp; x &lt;= 13

function isvalid(expression::Expression)
    nums = [expression[i] for i in (1:2:length(expression))]
    ops = [expression[i] for i in (2:2:length(expression))]
    return all(isnumber, nums) &amp;&amp; all(isoperator, ops)
end

function isvalid(expression::EncodedExpression)
    return isvalid(convert(Expression, expression))
end
</code></pre><p>It sometimes may be more convenient to define a function on <code>Expression</code> or
<code>EncodedExpression</code> but since we still want the function to work with
either type, we use <code>convert</code> to first transform the argument before calling
the function we defined. I don't know if this is an anti-pattern but I found it
pretty cool and made figuring out the various functions a lot easier. For
subsequent functions I'll leave out definitions that just do a conversion but
they're still present in the complete code.</p><h3 id="generating-a-random-start-population">Generating A Random Start Population</h3><p>To create a start population we need to be able to generate random valid
expressions.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function random_expression(; num_terms = nothing)::Expression
    num_terms = isnothing(num_terms) ? rand(1:2:EXPRESSION_LENGTH) : num_terms
    num_terms % 2 == 0 &amp;&amp;
        num_terms &lt;= EXPRESSION_LENGTH &amp;&amp;
        error("num_terms must be odd number")
    expression = []
    for i in (1:num_terms)
        if i % 2 != 0
            push!(expression, rand(Vector(1:9)))
        else
            push!(expression, rand(Vector(10:13)))
        end
    end
    return expression
end

isvalid(random_expression())
</code></pre><pre><code>true
</code></pre><p>I had initially set this function to always generate an expression of maximum
length but decided to instead pick a random length. The thought process was
that longer expressions had more active (non-empty) genes hence more genes for
crossover and mutation. However, this meant that the overall population would be
less diverse making it harder to arrive at a solution due to the population
being too similar.</p><p>Next is a function that shows a human-readable representation of expressions.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function showexpression(expression::Expression)
    if isempty(expression)
        return "empty expression"
    end
    return join([expression_chars[i+1] for i in expression], " ")
end

function showexpression(expression::EncodedExpression)
    return showexpression(convert(Expression, expression), show_result)
end

showexpression(random_expression(num_terms = 9))
</code></pre><pre><code>"1 + 6 * 6 * 5 + 6"
</code></pre><p>Pretty simple thanks again to being able to treat expressions as vectors.
Finally we can define the function to generate a random population.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">createpopulation(population_size = 100)::Vector{EncodedExpression} = map(
    Base.Fix1(convert, EncodedExpression),
    [random_expression() for _ in (1:population_size)],
)
</code></pre><p>We call <code>convert</code> through <code>Base.Fix1</code> whose usage is explained in the
documentation as:</p><blockquote><p><code>Fix1(f, x)</code>
A type representing a partially-applied version of the two-argument function f, with the first argument fixed to
the value "x". In other words, <code>Fix1(f, x)</code> behaves similarly to <code>y-&gt;f(x, y)</code>.
See also Fix2.</p></blockquote><h3 id="selecting-candidates-for-producing-the-next-generation">Selecting Candidates for Producing the Next Generation</h3><p>To produce the next generation we need to pick two "parents" from the current
generation's population according to their fitness. How do we do this? Well,
first we need to figure out how close a particular solution is to our desired
result. Since we're looking for an expression that evaluates to a particular value,
we need to first be able to evaluate expressions. Before we do this though we
need to take a little detour.</p><p>Over the course of our program, we are likely to have expressions that are not
strictly well-formed. However, instead of discarding the entire expression once
<code>isvalid</code> is <code>false</code>, it would be better if we could try and process the
expression into a valid one whenever possible. This means that an expression like
<code>1 + + 5 * 8 3 / 4</code> which is invalid would be turned into <code>1 + 5 * 8 / 4</code>
which is well-formed according to our previous rules.</p><p>To do this we need to check:</p><ul><li>that each entry in an expression is either a number or operator.</li><li>that each number and is followed by an operator or nothing and each operator
is followed by a number.</li></ul><p>We do this using <code>isnumber</code> and <code>isoperator</code> defined previously together with a
boolean flag that keeps track of whether we should expect a number next to
build a new expression.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function clean(expression::Expression)::Expression
    if isvalid(expression) || isempty(expression)
        return expression
    end
    expression = copy(expression)
    num = true
    result = []
    for i in expression
        if isnumber(i) &amp;&amp; num
            push!(result, i)
            num = !num
        elseif isoperator(i) &amp;&amp; !num
            push!(result, i)
            num = !num
        end
    end
    if num
        pop!(result)
    end
    return result
end

showexpression(clean(make("1 + + 5 -")))
</code></pre><pre><code>"1 + 5"
</code></pre><p>Since we're working with arrays we use <code>copy</code> just so we don't end up mutating
the original argument which may be needed unmodified outside our function.</p><p>Using <code>clean</code> we can make our evaluation function much simpler since we don't need to
include extra error handling for malformed expressions. Keep in mind that we
evaluate expressions in left to right order with all operators having equal
precedence.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function evaluate(expression::Expression)
    expression = clean(expression)
    result = Float64(popfirst!(expression))
    while !isempty(expression)
        o = popfirst!(expression)
        l = popfirst!(expression)
        if '*' == expression_chars[o+1]
            result *= l
        elseif '/' == expression_chars[o+1]
            result /= l
        elseif '+' == expression_chars[o+1]
            result += l
        elseif '-' == expression_chars[o+1]
            result -= l
        end
    end
    return result
end

function evaluate(expression::EncodedExpression)
    return evaluate(convert(Expression, expression))
end

evaluate(make("1 + 5"))
</code></pre><pre><code>6.0
</code></pre><p>For a fitness function we need the output to be larger the input is to our
target value.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function fitness_score(expression, target)
    if isempty(expression) || iszero(expression)
        return 0
    end
    return 1 / abs(target - evaluate(expression))
end

fitness_score(make("2 * 8"), 10)
</code></pre><pre><code>
0.16666666666666666
</code></pre><p>The right fitness function is dependent on what type of problem you're trying
to solve and even for our specific example there may be a better one. Try and
figure out a better one if you can and let me know in the comments.</p><p>We don't need to worry about divide by zero errors in Julia but we'd need to
check for this is we were using Python for instance. This works out nicely
since the fitness score for an expression matching our target is Infinity.</p><p>To actually select candidates for producing the next generation we need to use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_proportionate_selection">fitness proportionate selection</a> aka roulette wheel selection. This
function is is defined as</p><p>$$p_{i} = \frac{f_{i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N}f_{j}}$$</p><p>In simple terms this means that the probability of selecting a particular member
of the population $i$ is equal to it's fitness divided by the sum of all the
fitness scores for the entire population. Translating this to Julia can be
done easily by using the <code>sample</code> function from the <a href="https://www.juliapackages.com/p/statsbase">StatsBase.jl</a> package
which allows random selection based on provided probability weights.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">using StatsBase: sample, Weights

function roulette_wheel(fitness, population, size = 2)
    weights = fitness / sum(fitness)
    return sample(population, Weights(weights), size, replace = false)
end
</code></pre><p><code>fitness</code> is an array containing the fitness scores of the members in
<code>population</code> in the same order. (<code>fitness = fitness_score.(population)</code>).
<code>size</code> tells <code>sample</code> how many randomly selected items we want which saves us
the effort of calling this function twice to find each 'parent'. We also pass
<code>replace = false</code> to make sure that we do not return the same members of the
population for our selection.</p><h3 id="genetic-operators-crossover--mutation">Genetic Operators: Crossover &amp; Mutation</h3><p>Up-to this point other than the data representation there's not much
resemblance to natural selection in biology. We could a write a function <code>go</code></p><pre><code class="language-julia">function go(N = 100, n = 50, t = 20)
  population = create_population(N)
  fitness = fitness_score.(population, t)
  while !(Inf in fitness)
    fittestn = roulette_wheel(fitness, population, n)
    population = vcat(fittestn, create_population(N - n))
    fitness = fitness_score.(population, t)
  end
  return findfirst(isinf, population)
end
</code></pre><p>Although we could in theory find a solution this way, whether or not this
function returns in a reasonable time is impossible to tell. Crossovers and
mutations help improve our chances of finding a solution in a reasonable
time frame by mimicking nature.</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(genetic_algorithm)">Crossover</a> swaps the bits of two chromosomes starting a random point
similar to how genes combine during reproduction.</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_(genetic_algorithm)">Mutation</a> randomly flips a bit in a chromosome. It serves the purpose of
retaining the genetic diversity of a population. When the members of a
population become too similar to each other it slows down the convergence
towards a solution as mentioned before.</li></ul><p>There are other genetic operators as well as different variations for crossover
and mutation but we'll keep things simple for now. Here's crossover:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">const CROSSOVER_RATE = Float64(0.5)

function crossover(
    e1::EncodedExpression,
    e2::EncodedExpression,
    rate::Float64 = CROSSOVER_RATE,
)
    if rand(Float64) &lt;= rate
        e1 = copy(e1)
        e2 = copy(e2)
        position = rand(1:CHROMOSOME_SIZE-1)
        mask = EncodedExpression(0)
        for i = 0:position
            mask |= (EncodedExpression(1) &lt;&lt; i)
        end
        complement = ~mask

        c1_bits = e1 &amp; mask
        c2_bits = e2 &amp; mask

        r1 = e1 &amp; complement
        r2 = e2 &amp; complement

        r1 |= c2_bits
        r2 |= c1_bits
        return (r1, r2)
    else
        return (e1, e2)
    end
end
</code></pre><p>Both crossover and mutation are only performed according to some predefined
rate. There isn't really a 'correct' value for these rates so you'd probably have
to try different values and find what works for your particular problem or even
just for this one.</p><p>Crossover swaps bits by creating a mask and extracting the bits in the
required positions for each number before <code>OR</code>ing them in swapped order.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">const MUTATION_RATE = Float64(0.01)

function mutate(expression::EncodedExpression, rate::Float64 = MUTATION_RATE)
    if rand(Float64) &lt;= rate
        expression = copy(expression)
        position = rand(1:CHROMOSOME_SIZE)
        mask = 1 &lt;&lt; position
        return xor(expression, mask)
    else
        return expression
    end
end
</code></pre><p>Mutation also involves creating a mask, but this time we simply <code>XOR</code> the
chromosome with the mask to flip a bit at a randomly selected position. Since
both these functions operate on bits let's make a function to show expressions
as bit strings grouped into individual genes.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">asbitstring(expression::EncodedExpression) =
    string(expression, base = 2, pad = CHROMOSOME_SIZE)

function showencoding(expression::EncodedExpression)
    bitstr = asbitstring(expression)
    n = length(bitstr)
    formatted_bitstr = String[]

    for i = 1:GENE_SIZE:n
        push!(formatted_bitstr, bitstr[i:min(i + (GENE_SIZE - 1), n)])
    end
    return join(formatted_bitstr, ' ')
end

</code></pre><h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h3><p>We now have all the essential parts for making our genetic algorithm work but
there's two more things we can add to improve the UX of our program. The first is
a progress meter so we can keep track of how our things are going, and also some
way to store the results of each run. The latter especially is important if we
want to asses how different variations affect the performance of our program.</p><p>For progress <a href="https://www.juliapackages.com/p/progressmeter">ProgressMeter.jl</a> is trivial to use and has a bunch of useful
features. For saving data I'm partial to SQLite mostly because
Python - which is the language I use most - supports it in the stdlib but also
because it is file based which simplifies using SQL a lot. The <a href="https://www.juliapackages.com/p/sqlite">SQLite.jl</a>
package is necessary to use SQLite in Julia.</p><p>As an aside anyone with a good recommendation for a file-based document
database leave it in the comments please.</p><p>The statistics we want to collect are:</p><ul><li>Which target were we trying to find an expressions for.</li><li>The solution if one has been found.</li><li>The population at the time the algorithm terminates. It may also be useful to
collect the population for each generation but we'll leave that out for now.</li><li>How many generations have been run before terminating.</li><li>The total number of generations that can be run.</li><li>How many mutations have been done.</li><li>How many crossovers have been done.</li></ul><p>Most of these map easily to SQL datatypes except the population which is a
vector of expressions. For this field the simplest option was to use the
<code>JSON</code> type in SQLite. We also use <code>showexpression</code> to get the human-readable
version of each expression just so the database file is less tightly coupled to
the expression datatype we choose.</p><pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS experiment_stats (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  target REAL UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  population_size INTEGER NOT NULL,
  max_generations INTEGER NOT NULL,
  generations_run INTEGER NOT NULL,
  mutations INTEGER NOT NULL,
  crossovers INTEGER NOT NULL,
  solution TEXT,
  population JSON NOT NULL,

for storing them.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">using SQLite;

    stats[:population] = JSON.json(map(showexpression, stats[:population]))

</code></pre><p>All that's left is to try out our example with a few examples and see how
it does. From my exploration, with the default arguments to <code>ga</code> we were unable
to find a solution for numbers greater than 5000 more than 10% of the time. For
numbers lower than 5000 the percentage was a considerably higher. That closes
out our exploration of genetic algorithms. Be sure to leave any feedback in the
comments.</p><p><img src="/assets/thumbs_up.gif" alt="Thumbs Up" /></p><h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><ul><li>The idea for this project can from <a href="http://www.ai-junkie.com/ga/intro/gat1.html">this</a> article. It has implementations
of the same problem in different languages. I tried this out about 5 years ago
while learning C. It was a big nightmare but was the only non-trivial C
project I completed outside some stuff with flex and bison.</li><li>Really liking Julia so far. I've barely scratched the surface of it's
capabilities. I'm especially looking forward to trying <a href="https://makie.org/">Makie</a>. Anyone with tips
on how to improve my Julia game leave them in the comments.</li><li>Not usually a fan of YouTube videos for learning programming but I recommend
the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@doggodotjl">doggo dot jl</a> channel for getting introduced to Julia.</li><li>I wrote most of this using <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>. Need to try it more before I can
give a verdict.</li><li>I would like explore other optimization algorithms like Hill climbing and Simulated
Annealing as well as try make a few simulations. Recently watched a great video
about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSKMYc1CQHE">fluid simulation</a>.</li><li>Haven't even tried to make this program go fast yet which is something you'd have
to do if you wanted to use genetic algorithms in real life. Speed is also one
of Julia's main selling points.</li><li>We collect data from runs of our program but don't do anything with it. I
already started work on this and should be write a follow up article soonish.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/julius383/genarith">Here</a> is the repo with the entire code.</li></ul>
