    <p><code>Make</code> sometimes gets a bad rap mainly for some warts in it that are a
result of how old it is. It does have it's merits though since even in 2019
you are still more than likely to find a Makefile somewhere in most open
source project's repositories.</p><p>In this article I'll try and talk about the <em>coolest/strangest</em> features.
This article is not meant to teach you how to write a Makefile, why you
should bother learning, or the best practices. There are plenty of good
guides as well as entire books dedicated to the topic of <code>Make</code> (I like the
official <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">GNU Documentation</a>).</p><p>Most of the tricks in this article I learned while using Makefiles as a
way to store small snippets of code that do various tasks. Essentially
it was <code>Make</code> re-purposed as a generic task runner. The tasks
consist mainly of commands that I ran semi-regularly and are in-between
being too short to put in a separate file and too long to repeatedly
type into a shell. A link to the full Makefile is at the bottom. I
recently moved the tasks to using <a href="https://www.pyinvoke.org/">pyinvoke</a> that enables more
flexibility since some of the tasks required jumping through too
many hoops when using <code>Make</code>.</p><h3 id="conditional-assignment">Conditional Assignment</h3><p>The first one is not too difficult to understand, basically in Makefiles
you can assign a value to a variable unless it already has a value in
which case you just leave it alone. The way this looks is</p><pre><code class="language-makefile">DIR ?= ~/code/Python/
</code></pre><p>This is useful since it enables you to set default values for variables
but ensures that in case the user already specified a value, to use that
instead. Using conditional assignment allows your rules to be configurable
but also not fail when a value isn't supplied.</p><h3 id="eval"><code>eval</code></h3><p>It is very rare to hear <code>eval</code> in any language being spoken of positively
given that it is very easy to misuse. Regardless, due to the nature of
Makefiles as kind of an weird macro language, <code>eval</code> exists and is
sometimes useful. To understand how we'll go on a bit of a tangent.</p><p>If you've ever seen a Makefile you know that it roughly consists of a
bunch of variables followed by sections describing how to perform
certain tasks. The part that interests us are the task descriptions. The
syntax is roughly:</p><pre><code class="language-makefile">rulename: prerequisites
  command1
  command2
  ...
  commandn
</code></pre><p>The section with the commands is not technically <code>Make</code> in the sense that
it is treated as text that is just 'preprocessed' and then passed on to
the relevant program to be executed. Suppose we want to do <code>Make</code> specific
things like set variables in this section and have them persist in
Make's environment, <code>eval</code> comes in handy here:</p><pre><code class="language-makefile">py3-proj:
	$(eval DIR ?= ~/code/Python/)
	$(MAKE) -f $(AFILE) create-project DIR=$(DIR) TYPE=Python3 EDIT=$(EDIT)
</code></pre><p>What is happening above is first we checks if a <code>DIR</code> variable is already
set (perhaps was specified on the command line) before setting a default.
Then we call <code>Make</code> <em>recursively</em> (ðŸ˜Ž) to run a different rule with some
'arguments'.</p><h3 id="changing-shell">Changing <code>SHELL</code></h3><p>If I could only write about one interesting feature this would definitely
be it. I remember reading about it in the GNU docs and thinking it
was such a cool feature. The reason why is that it frees you from the
restriction of using <code>shell</code> which also has it's own unique set of problems.</p><pre><code class="language-makefile">SHELL = /usr/bin/python3
.ONESHELL:
chaos-game:
	import turtle
	from random import choice
	edges = [(-200, 200), (200, 200), (200, -200), (-200, -200)]
	current = choice(edges)
	last = edges[0]
	turtle.speed(0)
	turtle.penup()
	turtle.hideturtle()
	for i in range(5000):
	    while last == current:
	        current = choice(edges)
	    tx, ty = turtle.position()
	    new_x, new_y = ((current[0] + tx) / 2, (current[1] + ty) / 2)
	    turtle.setpos(new_x, new_y)
	    turtle.dot(8, "red")
	    last = current
	    current = choice(edges)

	turtle.done()
</code></pre><p><code>.ONESHELL</code> from the docs:</p><blockquote><p>If .ONESHELL is mentioned as a target, then when a target is built all lines
of the recipe will be given to a single invocation of the shell rather than
each line being invoked separately</p></blockquote><p><code>.SHELLFLAGS</code> is also a useful variable to set as it controls the arguments
that are passed to the program in <code>SHELL</code>. By default it is set to <code>-c</code>.</p><h3 id="canned-recipes-and-call">Canned Recipes and <code>call</code></h3><p>Canned recipes allow you to define a sequence of commands that can be
used in multiple recipes saving it in a variable. Combining this with
the <code>call</code> function leads to something very useful. <code>call</code> is used to
create new parameterized functions by writing an expression in a variable
(using <code>define</code> for instance) then expanding it with temporary variables
<code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code> and so forth that hold the arguments the call was made with.</p><p>Here is a useful example that adds simple notifications depending on the
exit status of the last shell command.</p><pre><code class="language-makefile">define notify =
if [[ $$? -eq 0 ]];then
  notify-send -t 5000 $1
else
  notify-send -t 5000 $2
fi
endef

# example usage
cap-screen:
	# Take screenshot of selection
	scrot -q 100 -s
	$(call notify, "Screenshot taken", "Failed to take screenshot")

</code></pre><h3 id="going-further">Going Further</h3><p>Turns out that <code>Make</code> is a lot more flexible than it appears at first
glance. There's a ton of more lesser known features I have not covered
here but are in the official documentation for GNU Make. Take a look at
it and feel free to send me an e-mail if you find another gem.</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/julius383/fc6ac44c241fcc60e1076da4a22a6169">gist</a> with the Makefile</li><li>The <a href="https://gmsl.sourceforge.io/">GNU Make Standard library</a> is full of crazy things you wouldn't think
