    <h2 id="pipes">Pipes</h2><p>If you've ever spent more than two seconds on anything resembling a Unix shell -
bash and friends - you've probably used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28Unix%29">pipe</a>. Basically a shell pipe,
represented by the bar character (<code>|</code>) on a keyboard, is a way of connecting the
output of one command to the input of another. Here's one example taken from my
shell history that changes all the <code>.txt</code> (text) files in the current and sub
directories to <code>.md</code> (markdown) files:</p><pre><code class="language-sh">find . -type f -name '*.txt' | rename .txt .md
</code></pre><h2 id="redirection">Redirection</h2><p>Taking the idea of controlling the input/output of a program further is
redirection. It uses the less-than and greater-than symbols (<code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>)
which control where input comes from and where output goes to respectively.
Compared to the relative simplicity of the pipe operator, redirection is
somewhat <a href="https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/io-redirection.html">overloaded</a>.
For example <code>cat file1.txt file2.txt &gt;&gt; file3.txt</code> would append the contents of
<code>file1.txt</code> and <code>file2.txt</code> to <code>file3.txt</code> while <code>cat file1.txt file2.txt &gt; file3.txt</code> would overwrite what was in <code>file3.txt</code> prior to running this command.</p><p>What's particularly useful for our purposes is the ability to use it with code
blocks. More specifically  <code>while</code>, <code>for</code> and, <code>if/then</code> blocks. The example
below prints out the character count and upper-cased version of each line of a
file. It's not a very practical example but bear with me a little.</p><pre><code class="language-sh">while read -r line
do
  echo -n "${#line}: " # expands to length of the variable line
  echo "$line" | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'
done &lt; data.txt
</code></pre><h2 id="process-substitution">Process Substitution</h2><p>One drawback of pipelines is they only work when programs use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams">standard
streams</a> for input and output and not when they only accept files. Process substitution lifts this restriction by creating files in <code>/dev/fd/</code>
to pass around the output of a process/program. The syntax is <code>&lt;(command)</code>,
note the lack of space between the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>(</code>, this is significant.</p><p>Why is this useful? Before we get to that let's recap what we've seen so far:</p><ul><li>Output from a process can be captured and sent somewhere else</li><li>That <em>somewhere else</em> can be a code block like a <code>while</code> loop</li><li>Code in the loop proceeds with processing as normal</li></ul><p>Combine all these and you get a concise solution to an otherwise tricky
problem.</p><h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3><p>I have a bunch of notes as plain markdown files that I keep synced between my
computer and phone with <a href="https://syncthing.net/">syncthing</a>. Overtime the
files have accumulated and become disorganized. I recently decided to try and
fix this. Using <a href="https://ranger.github.io/">ranger</a>, I am able to  group the
files into directories with related content. However, there's still a bunch of
files that although have descriptive filenames, would be better organized in a
single file under different headings.</p><h3 id="the-solution">The Solution</h3><p>I tried a couple of different approaches all of which were either too clunky
or didn't do <em>exactly</em> what I wanted. Eventually I was able to figure out the
following:</p><pre><code class="language-sh">cd ~/notes/some/dir
while read -r name
do
  echo "## $(basename $name)" &gt;&gt; grouped.md
  cat "$name" &gt;&gt; grouped.md
  echo -e "\n\n" &gt;&gt; grouped.md
done &lt; &lt;(find . -maxdepth 1 -type f)
</code></pre><p>Let's walk-through what's happening:</p><ul><li>Change into the directory containing the files</li><li>Run <code>find</code> which gathers the names of all the regular files in the
current directory only (<code>-maxdepth 1</code>).</li><li>Pass the names into the <code>while</code> loop using process substitution and
redirection as we have seen is possible.</li><li>Read each filename into a variable <code>name</code> available in the <code>while</code>
loop's body.</li><li>Write a level 2 markdown header into the output file (using <code>&gt;&gt;</code> for
appending).</li><li>Write the contents of the file <code>name</code> to the output file (again appending
is necessary).</li><li>Add newlines to delimit the different items.</li></ul><p>The end result is a single file with content under relevant headings all
without tedious copy-pasting or complicated code :). How would you have done it?</p><h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2><ul><li>Chapter 6 of <a href="http://www.linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php/">The Linux Command Line</a> although the entire book is great.</li><li><a href="https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/redircb.html">Redirecting Code Blocks</a> on the Linux Documentation Project.</li><li><a href="https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/process-sub.html">Process Substitution</a> also on TLDP. There are some great examples of when process substitution may be useful.</li></ul>
