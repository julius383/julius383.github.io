    <h2 id="background">Background</h2><p><a href="https://ranger.github.io/">ranger</a> is a terminal-based file manager that is written in Python.
This is interesting for a couple of reasons. One is that it nicely
integrates with the rest of the terminal. Another is that it can be
extended fairly easily. It also supports vim-like key bindings. That last
one may not seem like a merit but the interface ends up being really
intuitive.</p><p>As part of my ongoing effort to be more organized I decided it's about
time I sort my wallpaper collection. At first glance there's a couple of
ways to do this. But, by far the simplest is using sub-directories for each
distinct category. The problem is, even using  <code>ranger</code> with its simple and
intuitive interface ends up still being a lot of busy work. We all hate
busy work but as programmers we can potentially do something about it
(<a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">relevant xkcd</a>).</p><h2 id="organizing-images-into-sub-directories">Organizing Images Into Sub-directories</h2><p>The best way I could think of to save myself some time is to somehow bind a
key (like Space) to an arbitrary sequence of commands. Performing an action
which in this case would be moving whichever file is selected to some
sub-directory would just involve hitting a key. All that was left was actually implementing it.</p><p>Ranger is extended simply by adding a subclass of the <code>Command</code> class to
a file called <code>commands.py</code> in the ranger config directory. A sample
<code>commands.py</code> can be obtained by running</p><pre><code class="language-sh">ranger --copy-config=commands
</code></pre><p>The two methods of the <code>Command</code> class you should be concerned with are
<code>execute</code> and <code>tab</code>. The former should contain the code you want to run
when your command is executed. The latter can be used to provide completion
options when a user hits the <code>tab</code> key. For our purposes implementing
tab-completion isn't really necessary.</p><p>From what we've discussed so far, our new command needs to:</p><ul><li>Parse the sequence of commands entered by the user,</li><li>Interpret special placeholders representing either the currently selected
file or the current working directory,</li><li>Map the Space key to the user specified command sequence,</li><li>and, optionally restore the Space key to whatever it was. This isn't
necessary since the remapping lasts only until <code>ranger</code> is closed.</li></ul><h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2><pre><code class="language-py">
class bspace(Command):
    """:bspace [command]

    Temporarily bind a command to the space bar. {file} is
    replaced with the currently selected item and {cwd} with
    the current working directory. Run without arguments to
    restore the original binding.
    """

    def execute(self):
        # default binding for &lt;Space&gt;
        orig_binding = "mark_files toggle=True"
        if len(self.args) == 1:
            new_binding = orig_binding
        else:
            resolved_args = []
            for arg in self.args[1:]:
                # replace {file} with current file in command
                if arg == '{file}':
                    resolved_args.append('%p')
                # replace {cwd} with current working directory
                elif arg == '{cwd}':
                    resolved_args.append('%d')
                else:
                    resolved_args.append(arg)
            new_binding = ' '.join(resolved_args)
        self.fm.execute_console(f"map &lt;Space&gt; {new_binding}")
</code></pre><p>To use the command simply enter a command that you want to temporarily
bind to the Space key after <code>:bspace</code> in the ranger console. A couple of
useful examples are:</p><ul><li><code>:bspace delete {file}</code> - deleting a file (please be careful).</li><li><code>:bspace chain copy;cd ../paste;cd {cwd}</code> - copy a file to the parent
directory.</li><li><code>:bspace shell cat {file} &gt;&gt; somefile.txt</code> - appending to a particular
file.</li><li><code>:bspace chain cut;cd landscapes;paste;cd {cwd}</code> - the command we need
to organize images into sub-directories. Since ranger supports image
previews, all we need to do is go through the directory and hit Space
on every landscape image and it is moved to the relevant directory.
<code>landscapes</code> in the command can be changed when we want to put an image
in a different directory.</li></ul><p>Here's a gif of our command in action
