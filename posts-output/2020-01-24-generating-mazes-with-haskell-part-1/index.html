    <p>One of the first big projects I worked on was generating mazes. After
somehow coming across the book <a href="http://www.mazesforprogrammers.com/">Mazes for Programmers</a> (which to this
day is still probably my favorite programming book) I implemented most of
what was described and the results were <a href="https://github.com/julius383/mazes">cool as hell</a>. Fast forward a bit
and I once again stumbled upon something cool. This time it was
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, a lazy functional programming language. After reading about
it for a while and seeing it being pretty consistently used in Computer
Science research, I decided to try and learn it. Now anyone who's done
more than a little programming will tell you that working on a project is
the best way to learn a new language. After a bunch of thinking I
remembered my old maze project and my vague plan to eventually go through
the book again. With that and some friendly competition from my friend
Kenneth who was doing the same thing in <a href="https://github.com/hipstermojo/amazing-rust">Rust</a>, it was time to get
started.</p><h2 id="representing-mazes">Representing Mazes</h2><p>The first challenge of figuring out how to generate mazes is figuring out
how to represent them. The book takes the OO approach and defines a <code>Grid</code> and
<code>Cell</code> class. The <code>Cell</code> class contains information like its neighbours,
the <code>Grid</code> class, like the name suggests, has methods to initialize a grid
of cells into a maze among other things. This works fine but later in the
book non-square<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> mazes are introduced and new classes have to be
written. From the onset my goal was to try and write code that was as
general as possible. For that I needed a useful abstraction on the pattern
of mazes which was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Examples">graphs</a>.</p><p>Graphs are one of the coolest data structures in Computer Science. They
can be used to model problems in a wide range of fields and offer an
intuitive way to reason about them. For our purposes the property that we
use is the ability to show relationships between nodes by having an
edge between them. All the information we need is then encapsulated in the
structure of the graph and all the operations we need are already well
known graph operations. The problem then becomes how do we map a square
(rectangular) maze into a graph in a general way.</p><p>In Haskell, recursion is how you achieve looping which means that a lot
of your problems involve finding a way of breaking it down into smaller
chunks and combining the sub-parts into the final solution. Sound familiar?
This is of course <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm">Divide and Conquer</a> which as Wikipedia puts it:</p><blockquote><p>is an algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion. A
divide-and-conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem
into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these
become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the
sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem</p></blockquote><p>How then do we turn projecting a rectangular maze onto a graph, a Divide
and Conquer algorithm? The answer took me a while to figure out but can
be seen in the following image:</p><p><img src="/assets/gen.png" alt="Divide and Conquer Graph Creation" /></p><p>From the diagram we can see that at each step two things happen:</p><ol><li>A group of nodes - corresponding to the length and width of the
maze - are chosen. These are represented by nodes of the same colour.</li><li>The chosen nodes are connected together with connections being
represented by the arrows with the same colour as the nodes.</li></ol><p>The set of same coloured nodes and arrows represent a subgraph. When we
finally run out of unconnected nodes in the maze we start merging
the subgraphs by making the connections between them indicated by the
orange arrows. What we are left with in the end is a complete square maze
represented using a graph.</p><p>One final detail I needed to work out is that when working with a grid, it
is sometimes necessary and convenient to access the cells as rows and
columns. The property of graphs that is useful this time is the ability
to attach weights (or labels) to the edges. By having all the edges
connecting horizontally oriented nodes have a weight of one and all the
ones connecting vertical nodes have a weight of two, traversing all nodes
the same way as a nested for loop involves traversing horizontally
following the 'one' edges for all the nodes across the first column of
'two' edges<sup id="fnref-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p><p><img src="/assets/gen2.png" alt="Graph with Weights" /></p><h2 id="writing-the-code">Writing The Code</h2><p>With everything somewhat worked out all that was left was to write
some code. Thankfully there was no need to implement an entire graph
library from scratch as I found a fairly good one in <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fgl">fgl</a>. First step
is to create an empty graph with empty here meaning that none of the
nodes are connected to each other i.e there are no edges.</p><pre><code class="language-hs">emptyEdges :: [LEdge Int]
emptyEdges = []

mazeGraph :: Int -&gt; Gr Int Int
mazeGraph n = mkGraph (zip nodes nodes) emptyEdges
  where
    nodes = [1 .. n :: Node]
</code></pre><p><code>n</code> is the number of nodes you want so for a 10x10 maze <code>n</code> would be 100.
The next thing we need is a way to create an edge between two nodes. Since
the type for a labelled edge is <code>type LEdge b = (Node, Node, b)</code> i.e a tuple
of two nodes and a label, this is easy enough. <code>link</code> connects a list of
nodes into a chain.</p><pre><code class="language-hs">connect :: Int -&gt; Node -&gt; Node -&gt; LEdge Int
connect n x y = (x, y, n)

link :: Int -&gt; [Node] -&gt; [LEdge Int]
link n (x:y:xs) = connect n x y : link n (y : xs)
link _ _ = []
</code></pre><p>To actually create a square maze we need two functions <code>asSquare</code> which
creates the subgraphs and <code>merge</code> which combines them. Here's <code>asSquare</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-hs">asSquare :: DynGraph gr =&gt; gr a Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; gr a Int 
asSquare g 1 1 = merge g sg where
  sg = subgraph [n] g
  n = head $ filter (noEdges g) (nodes g) :: Node
asSquare g _ 0 = g
asSquare g 0 _ = g
asSquare g l w = merge g (asSquare newGraph (l - 1) (w - 1)) where
  entry       = head orphans
  avail       = tail orphans
  horiz       = take (l - 1) avail
  vert        = (take (w - 1) . drop (l - 1)) avail
  linkedHoriz = link 1 $ entry : horiz
  linkedVert  = link 2 $ entry : vert
  newGraph    = insEdges (linkedVert ++ linkedHoriz) g
  orphans     = filter (noEdges g) (nodes g)
</code></pre><p>From the type of the function we can see that it takes:</p><ul><li>A graph (<code>gr a Int</code>) with <code>Int</code> edge labels used for the <code>merge</code> step.</li><li>Two <code>Int</code> arguments which are the length and width of the required grid.</li></ul><p>The first pattern covers when only a single node remains which in
our image would be the bottom right node. In this case a singleton graph is
created and merged with the one passed in. The two following cases handle
rectangular mazes (when length and width are not the same) in which case
the passed in graph argument is already the complete graph.</p><p>The last case contains the actual algorithm that picks a bunch of nodes
and joins them like we saw in the diagram. <code>orphans</code> is the pool of
nodes without any edges that we choose from at each step. We first
take one node to be the corner then <code>l - 1</code> nodes for the horizontal
neighbours and <code>w - 1</code> for the vertical ones and link them up. Then we
call merge on the result of recursing with the new graph and a reduced
length and width.</p><p>Here's what <code>merge</code> does:</p><pre><code class="language-hs">merge :: DynGraph gr  =&gt; gr a Int -&gt; gr a Int -&gt; gr a Int
merge outer inner
  | all (noEdges outer) (nodes outer) = inner
  | otherwise =
    insEdges  (vert ++ horiz ++ innerCons) outer
  where
    innerHoriz = tail $ spf inner innerEntry
    innerVert  = tail $ lpf inner innerEntry
    innerEntry =
      case find (\x -&gt; null (inn outer x) &amp;&amp; null (out outer x)) (nodes outer) of
        Just x -&gt; x
    outerHoriz = tail $ spf outer outerEntry
    outerVert  = tail $ lpf outer outerEntry
    outerEntry = x
      where
        x =
          last $
          filter
            (\x -&gt; length (inn outer x) == 2 || length (out outer x) == 2)
            (nodes outer)
    vert      = zipWith (connect 2) outerHoriz (innerEntry : innerHoriz)
    horiz     = zipWith (connect 1) outerVert (innerEntry : innerVert)
    innerCons = labEdges inner \\ labEdges outer
</code></pre><p>For <code>merge</code> the only special case is when it's called with the graph with
no edges (i.e the start graph) and another one in which case the other one
is returned. In all other cases it's just a simple matter of finding the
horizontal, vertical and corner nodes of either graphs, and connecting them
up like we saw in the image with the orange arrows in the image. The
functions <code>lpf</code> and <code>spf</code> traverse neighbours by following either 'one'
(horizontal) edges or 'two' (vertical) edges respectively returning a list of
nodes. The merged graph is then created by inserting the new (and unique) edges
into the <code>outer</code> one.</p><p>The result of running <code>asSquare (mazeGraph 25) 5 5</code> is the graph<sup id="fnref-3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>:</p><p><img src="/assets/graphviz.png" alt="Square Graph" /></p><p>Running the binary tree maze generation algorithm on the resulting
'square' graph yields:</p><p><img src="/assets/bt-5x5.png" alt="5x5 Binary Tree" /></p><p>In case you're wondering, more general rectangular mazes work as well:</p><p><img src="/assets/bt-20x10.png" alt="20x10 Binary Tree" /></p><h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><p>Haskell is known for being a bit complicated but what I have realized so
far is that it only requires a slight adjustment in how you approach
problems. Most of the work with programming in Haskell like with every
other language still remains in first working out the details in your
head. Afterwards writing code is almost straightforward.</p><p>When I started writing this article I thought that the code was really
complicated but now it seems almost trivial (I hope). I've always wanted to
work with graphs and this project is perfect for that so expect a few more
articles in the coming weeks. Anyone reading this should consider picking
up a copy of <a href="http://www.mazesforprogrammers.com/">Mazes for Programmers</a> it's a great book. Don't worry if
you don't know Ruby which is what the author uses, the code samples are an
added bonus but the book goes over all the details you need to know to
follow along in whichever language you prefer.</p><h2 id="going-further">Going Further</h2><ul><li>The <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fgl">fgl</a> library is a true gem.</li><li><a href="https://archives.haskell.org/projects.haskell.org/diagrams/">diagrams</a> is another gem which I used to produce the Divide and Conquer
illustration and draw the mazes.</li><li>I recently learnt about another more recent <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs">graph library</a> that
although doesn't support what I need, is still pretty cool. The
