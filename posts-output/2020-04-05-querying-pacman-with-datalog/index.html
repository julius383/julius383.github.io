    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog">Datalog</a> is a declarative logic programming language that's normally
used in deductive databases. A deductive database works by using known
facts and a set of rules to determine (deduce) new facts. This is useful
for a couple of reasons the main one being that you are able to express
relationships that are really cumbersome (or downright impossible) in
relational databases.</p><h2 id="datalog-syntax--semantics">Datalog Syntax &amp; Semantics</h2><p>Being a declarative language the syntax itself is very simple. The short
version is that statements are divided into adding facts, adding rules and
querying the database (which is when the deduction is done). One other
action that can be performed is retraction which removes a fact from the
database although it is less common in practice. There is no single
canonical implementation for Datalog so syntax varies to some degree.</p><pre><code class="language-prolog">parent(mary, jane).
parent(bob, john).
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), ancestor(Z, Y).
parent(A, B)?
parent(bob, john)~
</code></pre><ul><li>The first 2 statements above add 2 new facts to the database i.e <code>mary</code>
is the parent of <code>jane</code> and <code>bob</code> is the parent of <code>john</code><sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</li><li>The next 2 statements are a rule describing how to tell if one person
is another's ancestor, specifying that they are an ancestor if they
are someone's parent or a parent of that person's ancestor.</li><li>The next rule is a query which has two variables <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, anytime
there is a variable<sup id="fnref-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> in a query the Datalog engine tries to find an
assignment to that variable that is either a known fact or a derivable
fact. So <code>parent(A, B)?</code> finds all the parent-child pairs in the
database.</li><li>The last statement is a retraction and just removes the corresponding
fact from the database.</li></ul><p>This is roughly all you need to know to understand the rest of this
article. I have glossed over a lot of details so give the
[appendix][appendix] a look if you want to know more.</p><h2 id="pydatalog">pyDatalog</h2><p>The WikiPedia page for Datalog lists a number of implementations and for
the Python programming language, the one listed is <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pydatalog/">pyDatalog</a>. It
implements the core Datalog functionality as well as some extensions that
make it useful in a wider range of problems. The Datalog syntax is embedded
in Python so the previous statements become:</p><pre><code class="language-py">+ parent("mary", "jane")
+ parent("bob", "john")
ancestor(X, Y) &lt;= parent(X, Y)
ancestor(X, Y) &lt;= parent(X, Z) &amp; ancestor(Z, Y)
parent(A, B)
- parent("bob", "john")
</code></pre><p>The exact way to use the library is described in the documentation with
some additional information shown in code inside the <code>examples</code> directory
of the pyDatalog repository.</p><h2 id="using-datalog-as-a-knowledge-base">Using Datalog as a Knowledge Base</h2><p>The deductive capabilities of a Datalog system make it a good candidate
for a knowledge base because on top of being able to store things you
know, you can store how to find out things you don't. For my particular
case I decided to store package information from <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman">pacman</a> the Arch Linux
package manager. Querying <code>pacman</code> for a package's information you get the
following output:</p><pre><code>Name            : clang

</code></pre><p>As you can see there is a bunch of useful information. Finding the
information associated with a single package is easy enough but
plain text was long ago proven to be a poor database. A relational
database could work but fields like <code>Depends On</code> and <code>Required By</code>
necessitate multiple tables for the sake of normalization which
already makes things annoying.</p><p>Here's where Datalog comes in, each item a package <code>Depends On</code>
can be stored as a single fact and be accessed just as easily. Practically
though there are a few hoops to jump through before getting to the
Datalog bit the first being extracting the package information. At first
I was simply parsing the output of <code>pacman -Qi &lt;pkgname&gt;</code> like what is
above but it's not really machine friendly. Luckily there's another tool
<a href="https://github.com/falconindy/expac">expac</a> which provides <code>printf</code> like functionality with package
information. The extraction function ends up becoming rather simple:</p><pre><code class="language-py">def get_package_info(pkgname):
    info = {}
    expac_fmt = ["%n", "%L", "%S", "%E", "%o", "%N"]
    prog = ["expac", "-Q", "\\n".join(expac_fmt), pkgname]
    keep = (
        "Name",
        "Licenses",
        "Provides",
        "Depends On",
        "Optional Deps",
        "Required By",
    )
    with subprocess.Popen(prog, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True) as proc:
        for i, line in enumerate(proc.stdout):
            if i == 0: # Name field
                info[keep[i]] = line.rstrip()
            elif line == "\n": # This field is empty
                info[keep[i]] = []
            else:
                info[keep[i]] = re.split(r"\s{2,}", line.rstrip())
    return info
</code></pre><p>Once the information about a package is collected into a dictionary, the
next step is putting it in a Datalog database.</p><pre><code class="language-py">@pyDatalog.program()
def _():
    for pkg in all_packages(): # list of all installed packages
        pkg_info = get_package_info(pkg)
        name = pkg_info.pop("Name")
        +is_pkg(name)
        for i in pkg_info.pop("Licenses"):
            +has_license(name, i)
        for i in pkg_info.pop("Depends On"):
            +depends_on(name, i)
        for i in pkg_info.pop("Required By"):
            +required_by(name, i)
        for i in pkg_info.pop("Provides"):
            +provides(name, i)
        for i in pkg_info.pop("Optional Deps"):
            +odepends(name, i)
    optional_for(X, Y) &lt;= odepends(Y, X)
    diff_license(X, Y, A, B) &lt;= depends_on(X, Y) &amp; has_license(X, A)\
        &amp; has_license(Y, B) &amp; (A != B)
    diffs = diff_license(A, B, C, D).data
    create_correlation_plot(diffs)
</code></pre><p>There's a couple of things worth mentioning about the above snippet.
Firstly, you normally have to first declare the identifiers you will use
in your pyDatalog statements with a line like <code>pyDatalog.create_terms(...)</code>
but the <code>pyDatalog.program()</code> decorator allows you to skip this step. It
runs the function it decorates making sure to call <code>create_terms</code> on any
unbound identifiers in the body. You have to be really careful with this
as you can end up with some subtle bugs in the form of unintentionally
creating terms you don't need. The decorator also functions like a <code>main</code>
function for you program.</p><p>You can probably guess what most of the function body does from our
discussion so far. <code>is_pkg</code> acts as a way to register the packages we
have and allows you to easily check if a certain package's information is
present. The subsequent set of <code>for</code> loops add some facts like the names of
a package's dependencies. Using our <code>clang</code> package as an example, that
means that a fact like <code>depends_on("clang", "llvm-libs")</code> is added.</p><p>After the facts is our first rule <code>optional_for(X, Y)</code> which adds a rule
that enables you to find the set of packages that is optional for some
particular package. As you can see this information is already in the
database albeit in a different form as the <code>odepends</code> (<code>Optional Deps</code>)
fact. With Datalog we can see that it is easy to add rules that align the
data more closely to our mental model.</p><p>The second rule is a lot more interesting. <code>diff_license(X, Y, A, B)</code>
taken piecewise consists of:</p><ul><li><code>depends_on(X, Y)</code> finds a package <code>X</code> that depends on package <code>Y</code></li><li><code>has_license(X, A)</code> finds the license <code>A</code> for package <code>X</code></li><li><code>has_license(Y, B)</code> finds the license <code>B</code> for package <code>Y</code></li><li><code>(A != B)</code> ensures that license <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are not the same</li></ul><p>With this rule added, a query <code>diff_license(A, B, C, D)</code> finds all
the packages where its license and that of a dependency differs. For
example one of the values returned would be <code>('clang', 'gcc', 'custom:Apache 2.0 with LLVM Exception', 'GPL')</code>. Pretty cool! The equivalent SQL
is not nearly as simple probably requiring at least a <code>JOIN</code>.</p><h2 id="visualizing-the-relationship">Visualizing the Relationship</h2><p>A bunch of <code>(package, package, license, licence)</code> tuples are good to have
but what we really want to know is how likely a package with a given
license has a dependency with some other particular license. More
concretely, how likely is it that a GPL licensed package has a MIT
licensed dependency. I'll skip the code and go straight to the result this
time<sup id="fnref-3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.</p><p><img src="/assets/corr.png" alt="License correlation matrix" /></p><p>There's a lot more you can do with this sort of Datalog backed package
database that I'm in the process of working out. I promise to update
this article with any other interesting results I obtain.</p><h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2><ul><li>The <a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/datalog">Racket</a> Datalog implementation comes with a simple <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/datalog/Tutorial.html">tutorial</a></li><li>The <a href="https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/ramsdell/tools/datalog/datalog.html">Lua</a> Datalog implementation is also decent.</li><li><a href="http://logic.stanford.edu/jarvis/complaw/ddb.html">This</a> article gives a nice introduction to deductive databases.</li><li>A detailed source of information on Datalog can be found in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/43410">this</a>
