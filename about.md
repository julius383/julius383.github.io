Hello and welcome, my name is Julius and on this website I intend to write about
various interesting things I've learnt or are working on. Feel free to send me
an [E-mail][1] to ask a question or just to chat. Also checkout my [GitHub][2]
where I occasionally put some of my work. [RSS][3] and [Atom][4] feeds are
available if you want to subscribe.

Some of the topics I enjoy discussing and would be happy to get an e-mail about
are:

* Programming Languages and PL Theory
* Projects you're working on and would like to discuss/brag about
* Linux and free software in general
* How you write code (editor, plugins, other tools)
* Functional Programming
* Interesting papers you've read
* Why vim is the best
* Game development
* Automata/regular expressions
* Scheme, Python, C, Bash
* Generally any CS topic

### Code

Unless otherwise stated the code on here is public domain.
